<p>Are you looking for a place to post shit but don't want to put it on Facebook or Twitter? What about a site that is so intentionally user-unfriendly that you can pretend you're better than the "normies" that use css? Do pictures and/or colors generally frighten you?</p>
<p>If you've answered "yes" to any of the above, then you've come to right place; <strong>diogn.es</strong> is exactly as unwelcoming and obtuse as you are!</p>
