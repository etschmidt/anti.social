<p>Are you looking for a place to post shit but don't want to put it on Facebook or Twitter? What about a site that is so intentionally user-unfriendly that you can pretend you're better than the "normies" that use facebook? Do pictures and/or colors generally frighten you?</p>
<p>If you've answered "yes" to any of the above, then you've come to right place; <strong>diogn.es</strong> is exactly as unwelcoming and obtuse as you are!</p>
<p>"User Experience" on the web has gone too far, and we're here to fix that.</p>
<p>On <strong>diogn.es</strong>, you'll find that every profile is set to 'private' by default.</p>
<p>User pages can <strong>only</strong> be found if that user's id number is known.</p>
<p>There is nothing else; there are no "stories", you cannot like someone else's post, you cannot message them, you cannot upload a picture, you cannot edit your own posts. This is it, enjoy (or don't)!</p>
